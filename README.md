# UCLouvain - LACTU2150 - Analyse statistique des donn√©es d'assurance

## Project Overview

This course covers the modeling claim propension, claim counts, claim severities and claim duration with generalized linear models (GLM), generalized additive models (GAM and GAMLSS), mixed models (GLMM) and generalized non-linear models (GNM). 

The analysis is conducted using R, leveraging its statistical capabilities to model and predict insurance costs based on various factors.
